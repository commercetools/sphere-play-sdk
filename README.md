# Sphere Play SDK

[SPHERE.IO](http://sphere.io) is the first Platform-as-a-Service solution for eCommerce.

## Deprecation notice

We gained a lot of experiences and learnings with this SDK for our SPHERE.IO platform.
To be transparent, let's list some drawbacks
- maintainability: Testability wasn't proper ensured.
- faster development: Extending the SDK with new or custom functionality required a lot of code changes.
- independency: Preselecting the Play framework and other libraries restricted it to a smaller user group.

The team put a lot of effort to address those and the result can be found in our new [JVM SDK](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-jvm-sdk).

Nevertheless, we will provide critical bug fixes for this SDK as long as we have customers using it.
